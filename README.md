##What is Hunting Adventure?

Hunting Adventure is an entertainment game made in Greenfoot that tests the player's skill using fast-paced, mouse-clicking action! Hunt for various animals in the forest with this point-and-click shooter and rack up your score in order to win! But watch out! You can't shoot through bushes and trees, so aim very carefully! You also have only 90 seconds to achieve victory, so make sure you watch your time. So get out there, hunter, and start shooting!
